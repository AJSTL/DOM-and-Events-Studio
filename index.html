When the "Abort Mission" button is clicked, the following should happen:
A window confirm should let the user know "Confirm that you want to abort the mission." If the user wants to abort the mission, then add parts b-d.
The flight status should change to "Mission aborted."
The background color of the shuttle flight screen should change from blue to green.
The shuttle height should go to 0.
When the "Up", "Down", "Right", and "Left" buttons are clicked, the following should happen:
The rocket image should move 10 px in the direction of the button that was clicked.
If the "Up" or "Down" buttons were clicked, then the shuttle height should increase or decrease by 10,000 miles.
23.8.3. Bonus Mission
If you are done with the above and have some time left during class, there are a few problems that you can tackle for a bonus mission.

Keep the rocket from flying off of the background.
Return the rocket to its original position on the background when it has been landed or the mission was aborted. -->
